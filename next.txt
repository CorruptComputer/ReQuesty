- Make required actually required
- Make nullable nullable, even when required (you can have for example, 'public required Guid? Test { get; set; }')
  - Its kinda goofy sounding, but it can help prevent errors if you want to always make sure something is set, even if its being set to nullable
- Simplify where possible, remove features that will go unused
