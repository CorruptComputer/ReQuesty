=======

This project was forked from https://github.com/microsoft/kiota at commit 960db6b2c39ce815dcabf4d2dec8a084fd218c8c. I will be keeping the same license as was there in this commit and have no plans to change that. This fork was made for my own personal use and there will be changes as I see fit, so this is probably not something you want to use.
